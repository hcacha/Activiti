/**
 * Simple tool to encrypt a file using a fresh random {@link DualCipher}.
 * Encrypted file will be written to the file-system, along with a set of keys
 * needed for creating a {@link DualCipher} to decrypt.
 * 
 * <br>
 * 
 * Usage: pass in absolute path to the file that needs encryption as
 * command-line argument. Encrypted file will be created in the same folder as
 * the original file and will remain unaffected. 2 additional files are created
 * containing both keys needed to construct a {@link DualCipher} later on.
